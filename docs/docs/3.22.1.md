## Patches

### What are Patches?
Patches are files that are used to replace existing core Koha files to extend the integration of the Koha EDS Plugin. The required feature/functionality cannot be provided through the plugin feature of Koha so core file are updated with additional code.

### Installing a Patch
[All patches are in the patches folder](https://github.com/ebsco/edsapi-koha-plugin/tree/Koha-v3.22.1x-to-Koha-v16.05.0x/Patches). Note the directory structure the patch is placed in on GitHub. This replicates the file location from the Koha Core root directory. For example if a file is in the Patches/opac/cgi-bin/opac location in GitHub; the file needs to be placed in <Koha Root>/opac/cgi-bin/opac directory on the server. If the file needs to be replace an existing file; please keep a copy of the original so you can rollback. Some functionalities may require changes to the plugin too.

For example the opac-sendbasket.pl integration required an update in the EDSScript.js file located in the js directory of the plugin. The variable ((patchSendCart)) needs to be set to 1. Refer to the release notes/comments associated with the file as it will contain instructions if any updated need to happen to the plugin.
